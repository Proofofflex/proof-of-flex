# Proof of Flex

Proof of Flex is a public on-chain leaderboard that displays voluntary USDC transfers
sent to a public treasury on Ethereum mainnet.

There are:
- no rewards
- no tokens
- no custody
- no promises

All transfers are verifiable on-chain and ranked by amount.
Wallet owners can optionally sign a message to claim a nickname,
proving authorship of the transaction without moving funds.

This is an experiment in on-chain proof and social signaling, not a product.
